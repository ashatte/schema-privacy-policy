<h2 style="text-align: center;">PRIVACY POLICY FOR SCHEMA</h2><br><br>
<p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application <em>schema</em> ("Application") for mobile devices that was created by Adrian Shatte. The Application is a research tool for Android and iOS devices. </p><br>
<h4>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h4> 
<p><strong>User Provided Information</strong> </p> 
<p>The Application obtains the information you provide when you enrol in a study and answer research questions within the Application. When you enrol in a study and complete questionnaires, the following information will be submitted to and recorded on the researcher's server: (a) a unique, anonymous user ID (randomly generated); (b) survey response data. Each study may use this information for data analysis and publication. You can read more about the data use for each study by reading a study's Plain Information Sheet in the "Info" section of the app. We do not collect or store any additional information on our own servers.</p> <br>
<h4>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h4> 
<p>This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device. The Application does check your phone's internet connection to determine whether it can submit data to the server, however no information about this connection is recorded or submitted to the server.</p> <br>
<h4>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h4> 
<p>The information we record is not shared with third parties and is only accessed by the researcher conducting the study. We may disclose User Provided Information:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li> <p>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p> </li> 
</ul> <br>
<h4>What are my opt-out rights?</h4> 
<p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. You can also request to opt-out via email, at <a href="mailto:adrian.shatte@gmail.com">adrian.shatte@gmail.com</a>.</p> <br>
<h4><strong>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</strong></h4> 
<p>We will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. If youâ€™d like the researcher to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact the researcher using the email provided in the "Settings" tab. Please note that some or all of the User Provided Data may be required in order for some aspects of the Application to function properly.</p> <br>
<h4><strong>Children</strong></h4> 
<p>We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:adrian.shatte@gmail.com">adrian.shatte@gmail.com</a>. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.</p> <br>
<h4><strong>Changes</strong></h4> 
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here and on the App Store/Google Play listings. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes. </p> <br>
<h4><strong>Your Consent</strong></h4> 
<p>By using the Application, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing," means using cookies on a computer/hand held device or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in Australia. If you reside outside of Australia your information will be transferred, processed and stored there under Australian privacy standards. </p> <br>
